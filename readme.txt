Description:

The first official program and first game that I've ever made. Created for an extensive school project. Entirely coded in 6502 processor-specific assembly.

Bug List:
- scores scroll with the background
- high scores do not save
- getting a game over while firing arrows breaks the graphics
- arrows will shoot too fast when holding B button
- arrows will fly back from the side of the screen if fired too fast
- when arrows are fired more than one at a time, enemy collision detection breaks
